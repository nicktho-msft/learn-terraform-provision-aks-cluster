# Learn Terraform - Provision AKS Cluster

This repo is a companion repo to the [Provision an AKS Cluster learn guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/kubernetes/provision-aks-cluster), containing Terraform configuration files to provision an AKS cluster on Azure.

Learning Terraform. Cloned repo from HashiCorp. Followed HashiCorp documentation listed above.

### Issues encountered
Using MSFT non-prod Azure tenant, ran into issues authenticating via az cli. This very simple doc helped me: [Switch Tenants in Azure CLI](https://dallin.blog/switch-tenants-in-azure-cli/).
